Pogger
======

Wrap your existing scientific code with `pogger`, and it will automatically
save timestamped archives of whatever said code produces.
This includes,

1.
    The console output in plain text,
2.
    Function return values in an hdf5 archive,
3.
    Matplotlib pyplot plots saved as images.

`Pogger` is designed so that it is easy to add to existing code, and it is
easy to remove so that code can be shared without being dependent on the pogger
system.
